# StopCloudflare
Stop using cloudflare, here's why

# Why?
While cloudflare may seem friendly and very good to you, you give them a lot of power. A dangerous amount of power. <br>
Cloudflare makes itself look as an "DDoS protection hero", but you grant them the power to revoke access to any site they wish (if its "protected" by cloudflare). Look at KiwiFarms for example, while i do not agree with their guidelines and harassing they still have a right to be on the internet. And what did cloudflare do? They kicked them off, and other companies followed aswell. 
<br><br>
Most people will just say "but it was a bad site, it doesn't matter". It does matter! Cloudflare just proofed that they can revoke access to any site they wish! If a site criticizes cloudflare for doing something bad, like hosting malware or something, they can start blocking access to them for violating some imaginary rule! Look what happened to Russia, a lot of big western companies blocked them from accessing the most basic stuff (Netflix, Instagram, McDonalds and even their bank accounts).
<br><br>
Cloudflare already "protects" 20% of the internet, which is a LOT of sites. And they can block anybody from those sites.
